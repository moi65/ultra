				<h1>Real Time Communication & Translation</h1>
				<p>
					Communication Access Real-Time Translation (CART), also called open captioning or real-time stenography, or simply real-time captioning, is the general name of the system that court reporters, closed captioners and voice writers, and others use to convert speech to text. A trained operator uses keyboard or stenography methods to transcribe spoken speech into written text. Speech to text software is used when voice writers provide CART.

					While real time speech to text serves many with hearing loss and deafness.
					</p>
				<p>It is also useful for people whose first language is different from the language being used, to understand speakers with different voices and accents in many group situations (at work, in education, community events), to have a "transcript', and for learning languages. CART professionals have qualifications for added expertise (speed and accuracy) as compared to court reporters and other stenographers.

					Another emerging method is voicewriting. 
				The voicewriter uses speech recognition software that instantly translates the spoken text into written text.

					Remote CART is done with the trained operator at a remote location.

						I am a professional and experienced software engineer with passion in programming and solve challenging problems. I currently working with latest open source web technologies like nodjs, couchdb, redis, gearman for developing distributed scalable RESTful API based web application. I also have experience in wide range or skills area(please check my likes list of technologies)

						I respect and believe in agile, scrum, refactoring, unit testing, have good eye on software architecture, code quality, maintenance effort etc.

						Problem solving is one of major key strength. Also, I believe in 'impossible is nothing'. So, I usually don't give up on a given problem and always find solution and iteratively improving it. I am open to any new technology that is more suitable for a domain of problem.

						I am also owner of a moderately popular programming blog site where I write articles about programming, software developments, server management/deployment etc related tutorials regularly in my free time to share my knowledge with the developers community around the world.

						I am web developer and currently working as Front End Developer at Vister Technology Inc. in Montreal, Canada. Programming is my passion and I love to work with web programming. When a new technology comes, I always try to learn it. I love to learn in every single corner on a technology. It feels amazing to me whenever I succeed solving/implementing a web development problem. We are a small team now, but I learn a lot of thing from my coworkers.
